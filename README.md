## Features

- Virtual DOM: React JS uses a virtual DOM to update the UI efficiently. When a user interacts with the UI, React updates the virtual DOM instead of the actual DOM, which is faster and more efficient. React then compares the updated virtual DOM with the previous version and only updates the parts that have changed in the actual DOM.
- No need to install app on pc to use osdag.
- we can access the app in one click.
- it is single page app.
